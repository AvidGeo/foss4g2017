    <h1>The importance of answering this call</h1>
    <p>We need your ideas, talents, and insights for the best possible conference!</p>
    <p>The quality of a conference is a function of the people who present and share their ideas, tools, and content. At FOSS4G, those people are <strong>you</strong>, the incredible community that develops and uses free and open source geospatial software.</p>
    <p>Presentations may be regular talks (20 minutes plus 5 minutes for Q&amp;A), posters, or maps. We expect to have 200–250 talks selected through this call. The selected presentations will be organized into approximately 9 parallel tracks, along with
        a poster and map gallery.</p>

    <h2>Selection Process</h2>
    <p>We expect to have 200–250 talks selected through this Call for Presentations. Keynote and invited presentations will round out the program. The volunteer FOSS4G Program Committee will lead the process but you, the attendees, will help select the presentations
        through an open <strong>Community Voting</strong> process. The most popular presentations will be included in the program, and the Program Committee will select the remainder to provide a diversity of voices and content.</p>

    <h2>Academic Papers</h2>
    <p>In addition to giving a regular talk or a poster, you may also choose to submit your work as an academic paper, with the goal of publication post-conference. The volunteer Academic Committee, will be providing further guidance on the academic paper
        timeline, review and selection process. So keep an eye on this page.</p>
    <p>All presentations with accompanying papers will be labeled as “academic presentations” in the conference program. However, these papers will be mixed in with both academic and non-academic presentations based on the presentation themes and topics.
        The Academic Subcommittee will support efforts to get the best papers published in appropriate academic journals and to potentially assemble a conference proceedings.
        <h2>Workshops</h2>
        <p>There are two days of workshops prior to the main conference days which gives many chances for hands on training. The call for workshops has begun. For more details, please visit <a href="../workshops">the Workshops page</a>.</p>
