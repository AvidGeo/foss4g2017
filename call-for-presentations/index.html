    <h1>The importance of answering this call</h1>

    <p>We need your ideas, talents, and insights for the best possible conference!</p>

    <p>The quality of a conference is a function of the people who present and share their ideas, tools, and content. At FOSS4G, those people are you, the incredible community that develops and uses free and open source geospatial software. </p>

    <p>Presentations may be regular talks (20 minutes plus 5 minutes for Q&amp;A), posters, or maps. We expect to have 200–250 talks selected through this Call, organized in approximately 8 parallel tracks, along with a poster and map gallery.</p>

    <p><em>If you would like to submit a conference workshop, please visit the <a href="../workshops">Workshops</a> page.</em></p>
