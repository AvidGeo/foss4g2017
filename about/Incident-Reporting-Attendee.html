<p align="center"><a href="../Incident-Reporting-Attendee.pdf" class="btn" style="background-color:#4480C2">Download Policy as PDF</a></p>
<p>This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative’s guide titled “<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports">Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports</a>” and PyCon 2017’s policy.</p>



<ol>
  <li>Contact either staff personnel Caitlin Gaborow, Guido Stein, Ashley Tardif or Michael Terner (info below). The staff will also be prepared to handle the incident. All of our staff members are informed of the code of conduct policy and guide for handling harassment at the conference. There will be a mandatory staff meeting onsite at the conference when this will be reiterated as well.</li>
  <li>Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to Caitlin, Guido, Ashley or Michael - all reports are confidential.</li>
  <li>When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident - Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.</li>
  <li>The important information consists of:
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing</li>
      <li>The behavior that was in violation</li>
      <li>The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report
was made)</li>
      <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
      <li>Other people involved in the incident</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The staff is well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.</p>
  </li>
    <li>If everyone is presently physically safe, staff will involve law enforcement or security only at a victim’s request. If you do feel your safety in jeopardy please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement by dialing 911. If you do not have a cell phone, you can use any hotel phone or simply ask a staff member.</li>
</ol>

<p>All reports should be made directly to

<ul>
  <li>Caitlin Gaborow, Conference Organizer</li>
  <li>Guido Stein, Conference Co-Chair</li>
  <li>Ashley Tardif, Conference Operations Coordinator</li>
  <li>Michael Terner, Conference Chair</li>
