    <h1 id="what-is-foss4g">What is FOSS4G?</h1>
        <p>The annual FOSS4G conference is the largest global gathering focused on open source geospatial software.
          FOSS4G brings together developers, users, decision-makers and observers from a broad spectrum of organizations and fields of operation.
          Through six days of workshops, presentations, discussions, and cooperation, FOSS4G participants create effective and relevant geospatial products, standards, and protocols.</p>

        <p>FOSS4G has been held all over the world and draws attendees from over 40 countries.
          Bonn, Germany hosted the conference in 2016. In 2017, Boston, Massachusetts, USA will host.</p>

      <p><strong>Can I register for workshops without registering for the conference?</strong><br />Yes, as of May 18th there is the option to register for workshops only.</p>
      <p><strong>Is there a volunteer program for FOSS4G?</strong><br />Yes, the volunteer program and application will be released by June 1st with high priority given to students.</p>
      <p><strong>I missed the deadline, can I still send in an abstract?</strong><br />Unfortunately, the Call for Abstracts has closed and we are no longer accepting submissions. That being said, we are pleased to have received over 420 submissions this year</p>
      <p><strong>Are there any discounts for students, accepted speakers, etc.?</strong><br />Our discount is the Early Bird rate, which ends May 16th. For students, we suggest volunteering when we release the volunteer application.</p>
