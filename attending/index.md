The Gala will take place Thursday, August 17th at the [New England Aquarium](http://www.neaq.org/). NEAQ has for almost 50 years been one of the premier visitor attractions in Boston and is a leader in ocean exploration and marine conservation.  Attendees will enjoy a strolling dinner while taking in all the exhibits starring the newly renovated cylindrical 4-story tall [Giant Ocean Tank](http://www.neaq.org/exhibit/giant-ocean-tank/).  The GOT replicates a Caribbean coral reef and features 90 year old [Myrtle the turtle](http://www.neaq.org/animal/green-sea-turtle/) and over 1,000 sea creatures.  The [Shark and Ray Touch Tank](http://www.neaq.org/exhibit/shark-ray-touch-tank/) will allow for personal interaction with these animals (the rays love to be petted!).  In addition to indoor marine life, a patio space on the harbor will provide a chance to view the summer boat traffic in the harbor.
