    <h2>FOSS4G Academic Program Timetable and Future Events</h2>
        <p><strong>For participants in the FOSS4G 2017 Academic Track:</strong> Weâ€™ve conducted a review of submitted abstracts under a double-blind process, described in a <a href="../program/academic-review/">blog post</a>.
          Now, we want to provide information for participants on the process ahead.</p>

          <h4>After Submission</h4>
             <ul class="nbull">
               <li><strong>Mid June</strong></li>
                   <li>Each Academic Program Committee member will be assigned 4-5 papers or posters to review and provide comments. Papers and posters will be reviewed with two goals in mind:</li>
                     <ul>
                       <li>Quality for the conference proceedings - any recommended edits will be forwarded to the authors</li>
                       <li>Recommendations for the "top tier" papers for possible publication for a special issue of a journal (not yet finalized)</li>
                     </ul>
                  <li>We will be using a paper review management system from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to manage the review process.<br /><br /> Reviewer comments for the authors are due by the last week of June.</li>

              <li><strong>Early July</strong></li>
                 <li>Authors will be notified of the reviewer's comments. They will then be asked to make revisions and edits for inclusion in the conference proceedings.</li>

              <li><strong>Late July/Early August</strong></li>
                 <li>Conference proceedings will be finalized that will include both papers and posters.</li>

             <li><strong>September</strong></li>
                <li>Conference proceedings will be published on the OSGeo Journal Website.</li>
             </ul>
