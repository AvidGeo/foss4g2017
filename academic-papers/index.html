    <h2>FOSS4G Academic Program Timetable and Future Events</h2>
        <p>For participants in the FOSS4G 2017 Academic Track, we want to provide more information on the process ahead. First, as you probably understand, weâ€™ve conducted a review of submitted abstracts under a double-blind process, described in a <a href="../_posts/academic-review/">blog post</a>.
          Now we want to provide information for participants and for the academic program committee on the process ahead.</p>

    <h4>Planned Schedule</h4>
        <p><strong>May 28, 2017</strong></p>
        <p>Completed academic papers or posters for FOSS4G Proceedings are due. Templates for formatting are provided below. We will be providing information on how to submit completed papers in a few weeks in subsequent blog posts and in in-person emails. Stay tuned.</p>

        <p><strong>June</strong></p>
        <p>Each Academic Program Committee member will be assigned 4-5 papers or posters to review and provide comments. Papers and posters will be reviewed with two goals in mind:
           <ul>
              <li>Quality for the conference proceedings - any recommended edits will be forwarded to the authors</li>
              <li>Recommendations for the "top tier" papers for possible publication for a special issue of a journal (not yet finalized)</li>
          </ul></p>
        <p>We will be using a paper review management system from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to manage the review process.<br /><br /> Reviewer comments for the authors are due by the last week of June.</p>
