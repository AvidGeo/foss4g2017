    <h2>FOSS4G Academic Program Timetable and Future Events</h2>
        <p>For participants in the FOSS4G 2017 Academic Track, we want to provide more information on the process ahead. First, as you probably understand, weâ€™ve conducted a review of submitted abstracts under a double-blind process, described in a <a href="../program/academic-review/">blog post</a>.
          Now we want to provide information for participants and for the academic program committee on the process ahead.</p>

    <h4>Schedule</h4>
        <ul class="nbull"><li><strong>Late January</strong></li>
                <li>Call for Abstracts opened</li>
            <li><strong>March 21, 2017</strong></li>
                <li>Call for Abstracts closed. In total, 49 abstracts were received under the Academic Program.</li>

        <li><strong>April 18, 2017</strong></li>
            <li>Abstracts were assigned to the volunteers of the Academic Committee. Each volunteer reviewed 7 abstracts.</li>

        <li><strong>April 27, 2017</strong></li>
            <li>Final decisions were given to authors on the status of their abstract in the Academic Program: Accept Oral, Accept Poster, or Reject</li>

        <li><strong>May 28, 2017</strong></li>
            <li>Completed academic papers or posters for FOSS4G Proceedings are due. Templates for formatting are provided <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/academic-papers/#template">below</a>. We will be providing information on how to submit completed papers in a few weeks in subsequent blog posts and in in-person emails. Stay tuned.</li>

        <li><strong>Mid June</strong></li>
            <li>Each Academic Program Committee member will be assigned 4-5 papers or posters to review and provide comments. Papers and posters will be reviewed with two goals in mind:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Quality for the conference proceedings - any recommended edits will be forwarded to the authors</li>
                <li>Recommendations for the "top tier" papers for possible publication for a special issue of a journal (not yet finalized)</li>
              </ul>
           <li>We will be using a paper review management system from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to manage the review process.<br /><br /> Reviewer comments for the authors are due by the last week of June.</li>

       <li><strong>Early July</strong></li>
          <li>Authors will be notified of the reviewer's comments. They will then be asked to make revisions and edits for inclusion in the conference proceedings</li>

       <li><strong>Late July/Early August</strong></li>
          <li>Conference proceedings will be finalized that will include both papers and posters.</li>

      <li><strong>September</strong></li>
         <li>Conference proceedings will be published on the OSGeo Journal Website</li>
      </ul>
