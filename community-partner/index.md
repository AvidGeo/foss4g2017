FOSS4G Boston 2017 wants to make connections and build community. For this reason, we are offering a Community Partner program where we work with other non-profit organizations to promote ideas and connect people. Through this program we will offer:

- **half a table in the exhibit hall**
- **1 full pass to the conference**
- **1 exhibitor pass**
- **logo space on the [FOSS4G homepage]({{ site.baseurl }}/#sponsors){:style="text-decoration:underline;"}**

 In return we are asking for your help in promoting [OSGeo](../about/#about-osgeo){:style="text-decoration:underline;"} and FOSS4G on your website and/or at your events.

This is limited to **eight** non-profit organizations. If you are interested in applying, please email <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="mailto:foss4g2017@gmail.com">foss4g2017@gmail.com</a>
