<em>To submit a presentation for the main conference program, please visit the <a href="../call-for-presentations">Call for Presentations</a> page.</em>

Workshops are an important and popular part of FOSS4G, and this year they will take place during the two days before the conference on <strong>Monday, August 14 and Tuesday, August 15</strong>. The workshops will be held at Harvard Universityâ€™s Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA). The workshops will be run by experienced members of the open source community, and sometimes by the open source project developers themselves. This makes the workshops a great opportunity to advance your skills or take your first steps into the world of Open Source GIS. This year we are excited to introduce a Maptime track, focused on introductory skills and tutorials, and will be featuring <strong>workshops at a wide variety of skill levels</strong>.

#### Workshop Description and Environment

Most workshops are half-day (4 hour) and all provide hands-on experiences with participants following along with an instructor. We will consider a limited number of full day (8 hour) workshops.

All workshops will be BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). While this allows for more participants, past experience has shown that this may increase setup time. Instructors are strongly encouraged to use bootable media such as the OSGeo Live USB stick to reduce set-up time and to increase efficiency. Presenters may also increase efficiency by setting up server side tutorials for their workshop. OSGeo Live USB sticks will be provided to all workshop participants.

We recognize that it requires a considerable amount of effort to produce a high-quality workshop. You are strongly encouraged to develop material for attendees to take home with them, such as handouts, a workbook, CD-ROMs, etc.

#### Workshop Topics

We are looking for dynamic instructors on a variety of topics.

* QGIS/PyQGIS
* PostGIS
* GeoServer
* MapServer
* Web Mapping
* GRASS GIS
* GDAL/OGR CLI Tools
* pgRouting
* Using OSGeoLive
* GeoPython
* GvSig
* Aerial Mapping and Point Clouds/LIDAR/Photogrammetry
* Using open source GIS in a cloud environment

We are open minded to additional topics that are relevant to the FOSS4G community and will generate interest.

#### Call for Workshop Submission Process
