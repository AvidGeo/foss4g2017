#### Conference Workshops - August 14-15

##### Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA

Workshops are a popular part of FOSS4G, and this year will take place the two days before the conference (Monday, August 14 and Tuesday, August 15) at the Center for Geographic Analysis at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA. Workshops are run by experienced members of the open source community, and sometimes by the project developers themselves, making them a great opportunity to advance your skills or take your first steps into the world of Open Source GIS. This year we are excited to introduce a Maptime track, focused on introductory skills and tutorials, and will be featuring workshops at a wide variety of skill levels.

#### Workshop Description and Environment
Workshops are half-day(4 hour) hands-on experiences with participants following along with an instructor. We will consider a limited number of full day (8 hour) workshops. 

Workshops will be BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). This allows for more participants, but past experience has shown that this may increase setup time. Instructors are strongly encouraged to use bootable media such as the OSGeo Live USB stick to reduce set-up time and to increase efficiency. Presenters may increase efficiency by setting up server side tutorials for their workshop. OSGeo Live USB sticks will be provided to all participants. 

It requires a considerable amount of effort to produce a high-quality workshop. You are strongly encouraged to develop material for attendees to take home with them, such as handouts, a workbook, CD-ROMs, etc.

#### Workshop Topics
We are looking for dynamic instructors on a variety of topics.

* QGIS/PyQGIS
* GvSig
* GeoServer
* MapServer
* PostGIS
* GDAL/OGR CLI Tools
* pgRouting
* Using OSGeoLive
* GRASS GIS
* GeoPython
* Aerial Mapping and Point Clouds/LIDAR/Photogrammetry
* Web Mapping 
* Using open source GIS in a cloud environment

#### Workshop Submission
If you have interest in leading a workshop, we encourage you to submit a proposal. Submissions will be accepted until March xx, 2017, and can be submitted at the following link:
(url here)

Workshop proposals should contain the following information:
1. Title summarizing the tutorial goals or workshop theme
2. Name and affiliations of the organizers
3. Max two-page description about the relevance, motivation and goals of the workshop, as well as pointers to past editions, if any.
4. Length of workshop, including if it is a half- or full-day workshop

#### Workshop Proposal Review
The workshops committee will review each submission and select those with the highest scores in diversity, originality, and relevance of the proposed topic.

#### Presenter Compensation
Workshop presenters will be compensated with a single payment of $650, equivalent to the cost of an Early Bird registration. Compensation is limited to one presenter, workshops with multiple presenters will still only receive one payment of $650.
