    <h1>The importance of answering this call</h1>

    <p>We need your ideas, talents and insights for the best possible conference.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the quality of a conference is a function of the people who are presenting and the content they are sharing. At FOSS4G, that content comes from <strong>you</strong> the people who make and use FOSS4G software and the incredible sharing
        culture that surrounds this community.</p>

        the program through an open “Community Voting” process. The top vote getters from Community Voting will be included in the program and the Program Committee will select the remainder of the program to provide a diversity of voices and content.</p>
