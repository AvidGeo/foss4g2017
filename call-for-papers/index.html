    <h1>The importance of answering this call:</h1>

    <p>We need your ideas, talents and insights for the best possible conference.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the quality of a conference is a function of the people who are presenting and the content they are sharing. At FOSS4G, that content comes from <span style="font-size:1.3em">you</span> the people who make and use FOSS4G software and the
        incredible sharing culture that surrounds this community.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Process</h2>
        <p>We expect to have room for 200-250 talks selected through this Call for Presentations. Keynote and invited presentations will round out the progam. The volunteer FOSS4G Program Committee will lead the process but you, the attendees will help select
            the program through an open “Community Voting” process. The top vote getters from Community Voting will be included in the program and the Program Committee will select the remainder of the program to provide a diversity of voices and content.</p>
