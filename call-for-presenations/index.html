    <h1>The importance of answering this call</h1>

    <p><strong>We need your ideas</strong>, talents and insights for the best possible conference.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the quality of a conference is a function of the people who are presenting and the content they are sharing. At FOSS4G, that content comes from <strong>you</strong> the people who make and use FOSS4G software and the incredible sharing
        culture that surrounds this community.</p>
